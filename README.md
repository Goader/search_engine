# Search engine
 Simple search engine based on Latent Semantic Indexing along with SVD low rank approximation in order to reduce noises and clusterize documents. Wrote a few scrapers to collect the data, and a Flask application for frontend.

A mini project for Numerical Algorithms Course at AGH UST.
